Steps done in this branch:

1.	Create the “Load Data” module to load data from the .csv file into data structure. Process text into dictionaries with keys are the attributes given.

2.	Apply unit testing to the loaded data to ensure the loading process is done properly.

3.	Convert the dictionaries into lists of students. Create bubble sort and selection sort functions to return sorted data based on attributes (age, health,...)

4.	Make an interpolation function to return the polynomial that best fits the data using numpy polyfit in the “Sort Plot” module.

5.	Data plotted in histograms using Matplotlib in the “Sort Plot” module. 

6.	In the “Optimization” module, use scipy to find the max and min data in a curve function. 

7.	“Text_UI” module allows direct command inputs in the terminal, while “Batch_UI” reads strings of commands in the test.txt text file.
